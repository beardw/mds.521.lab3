## Grocery Math
Let's begin with the basics and print our our result.
If Bob needs ten apples and they cost $2 each. How much money should Bob take to the grocery store?

```{r}
num_apples <- 10
cost_apples <- 2
total <- num_apples * cost_apples

print(paste("Bob needs to take", total, "dollars with him."))
```

## Time to Exercise!
It's squats day - let's see how many reps you'll be doing!
```{r}
exercise <- "squats"

if (exercise == "lunges") {
  reps <- 10
} else if (exercise == "pushups") {
  reps <- 15
} else if (exercise == "squats") {
  reps <- 25
} 

if (is.numeric(reps)) {
  print(paste("You must to do", reps, "reps of", exercise))
} else {
  print("You're lucky! Take a break!")
}
```
